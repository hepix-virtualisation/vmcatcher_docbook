    <para>&vmil; are a extendible meta data format used to transfer &vmi; from end 
    user to cloud resource provider. &vmil; within a working group of &hepix;.
    &hepix; is a twice yearly conference made up from sites providing compute and 
    storage services for &hep;. &hepix; focusses on the compute, network and storage 
    infrastucture required for &hep; sites.

      <title>&vwg; Observations</title>
      <para>
        The spring 2009 &hepix; conference made the following observations:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>&hep; will want consistent images across sites.</listitem>
          <listitem>The Grid is a homogeneous OS environment so requiring &hep; to coordinate OS upgrades across multiple experiments.</listitem>
          <listitem>The Grid will need to be shared with non &hep; community.</listitem>
          <listitem>&hep; experiments are very coupled to OS.</listitem>
          <listitem>Hardware is coupled to OS version.</listitem>          
          <listitem>Sites believe &vmi;'s are going to be the execution environment for &hep; jobs in the future.</listitem>
          <listitem>&chroot;, and &xen; based &vee; where already present at &hepix; sites.</listitem>  
        </itemizedlist>
        With these observations the &vwg; was formed.
      </para>
      <para>
        A new generation of &vee; such as &openstack;, &opennebula; and &nimbus; where already being developed.

      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>Produce a framework to securely run &vmi;'s across multiple sites supporting &hep;.</listitem>
          <listitem>Sites need control over &vmi; selection.</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        With these objectives the &vwg; was created with Tony Cass as its leader.
